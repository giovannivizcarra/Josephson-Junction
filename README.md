# Josephson Junction Lab (JOS)

The Josephson AC and DC Effect is a quantum mechanical effect that occurs when 2 superconductors come in contact with some insulating material connecting each other in their superconducting state (at extremely low temperatures), such that the electrons across the insulating material are coupled together and create supercurrents. This experiment focused on measuring the AC and DC effect once we were able to do so we were able to use our data from the AC effect to calculate 2e/h.
